Forth Naming
============

Most commonly-used words' names are taken from the Forth 2012 standard at [forth-standard.org](https://forth-standard.org/). Some other names have been changed in an attempt to make the naming more intuitive and consistent.

If a word only "should" exist in machine code, it is surrounded by parentheses, for example:

-	`(DOCOLON)`
-	`(EXIT)`
